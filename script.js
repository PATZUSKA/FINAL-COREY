But, just remember:
You don't have to be perfect.
It's okay to be having a bad day, our life is made of that, one day you will be in your best moment and in another day your worst, that's life, but don‚Äôt forget that life still goes on.  
Let's get through this together."`,

        weak‚òπÔ∏è: `"I'm proud of you. (:

Most people don't know your story, and even me I don‚Äôt know all your struggles, your hustle, your prayers.  
But one thing I know is that I‚Äôm proud of you, I‚Äôm proud of the man you are, the man you are becoming, and the man you will be.  
So don‚Äôt let those silent battles have you, and hang on."`,

        loveüíú: `"Have you ever missed someone so much that it feels like a physical ache? Have you ever found yourself staring at your phone, hoping for a message from them, wishing for just a sign that they‚Äôre thinking about you too? Has the idea of that one person texting you ever made you forget about everything else, making it hard to focus on anything? Have you ever loved someone so deeply, that even the smallest thought of them brightens your whole day? I have. And I do all the time.

It still feels unreal that someone like you could care about me the way you do. Sometimes, I get lost in my thoughts, overanalyzing things I shouldn‚Äôt, but I try to keep it to myself. I don‚Äôt want to be too much, to take up too much space in your life, so I hold back. Maybe too much. And I know that sometimes it might seem like I‚Äôm distant, but it‚Äôs never because I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs the opposite‚ÄîI care so much that I don‚Äôt want to suffocate you with it.

I tell you I love you because I mean it, but I also try not to say it too much, not because I don‚Äôt feel it, but because I don‚Äôt want it to lose its meaning. I don‚Äôt want to overwhelm you. I might not always be the best at showing love the right way, but I promise, every little thing I do is because you mean the world to me."`,

There is no reason. There should be no reason. If you love someone because of a reason, when that reason is gone, your heart will change too.

I like you because you are you."`,
